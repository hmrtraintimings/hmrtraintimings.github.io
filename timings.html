    <p>The Hyderbad Metro Trains will start at 5:00 (AM) in the morning and will run upto 11:00 (PM) in the night. HMR informed that the trains will be run one in every 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>In the first phase that was launched on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2017, there are <strong>16 trains<</strong> that are being operated between <strong>24 stations</strong> present in the <strong>Miyapur - Nagole</strong> corridor. This is the route which covers 30 kilometres in it. </p>
    <p>The metro trains will stop for 20 seconds in every metro station but they will stop for 30 seconds in the Ameerper Metro Station, this is because the Ameerpet Metro Station is the junction for the line I and line II.  At this Ameerpet Metro Station, there will be two routes coming and meeting here. Generally, all the Metro Stations are of 2 floors, the first one is the <strong>commercial space, Ticketing and Help desk</strong> and the second floor is the place where trains will come (Platforms).  BUt this is not the same with Ameerpet Metro Station. Here there 3 floor, the first one is the <strong>commercial space</strong>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor is the place where trains from one route will stop and the r<sup>rd</sup> floor where the trains from other route will stop. </p>
